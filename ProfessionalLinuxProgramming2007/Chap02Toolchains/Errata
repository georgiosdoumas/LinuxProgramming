page 28
I do not know what version of gcc the authors were using in 2007, but now on my gcc 4.8.4
the line 
 gcc -o trig -lm trig.c
is wrong , and the correct way to link the math library is 
 gcc -o trig  trig.c -lm 

page 29 An Example Shared Library
the line : 
 gcc -o goodbye -lmessage -L. main.o
should be replaced with : 
 gcc -L. -o goodbye_shared main.o -lmessage
First of all ,since on page 27 an executable has been created with :
 gcc -o goodbye message.c main.c
then the new executable will have another name : goodbye_shared
to contrast it with the existing goodbye , and after doing an ls -l
we can even see that the goodbye_shared is a little smaller than goodbye.
Then the order of where you put the options matters for my gcc 4.8.4
so the correct way is  gcc -L. -o goodbye_shared main.o -lmessage
