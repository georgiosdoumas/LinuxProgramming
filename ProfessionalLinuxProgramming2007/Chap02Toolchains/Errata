I do not know what version of gcc the authors were using in 2007, but now on my gcc 4.8.4
the line 
 gcc -o trig -lm trig.c
is wrong , and the correct way to link the math library is at the end :
 gcc -o trig  trig.c -lm 
 so no seperation ,with -lm, of the produced executable and the source code is allowed

page 29 An Example Shared Library
the line : 
 gcc -o goodbye -lmessage -L. main.o
should be replaced with : 
 gcc -L. -o goodbye_shared main.o -lmessage
First of all ,since on page 27 an executable has been created with :
 gcc -o goodbye message.c main.c
then the new executable will have another name : goodbye_shared
to contrast it with the existing goodbye , and after doing an ls -l
we can even see that the goodbye_shared is a little smaller than goodbye.
Then the order of where you put the options matters for my gcc 4.8.4
so the correct way is  gcc -L. -o goodbye_shared main.o -lmessage

page 30 
As a consequence of the logic that the text wants to present 2 programs 
the line of the 1st code block: 
 $ ldd goodbye
should be replaced with :
 $ ldd goodbye_shared
and the last execution of: 
 $./goodbye
 refers to the older program and should be replaced with: 
 $./goodbye_shared 
 to prove that the command export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`  did its job well. 

page 39 GNU Make
the correct file is not the file that is provided in the downloadable code , 
neither what is shown in the book , but what I have placed under the dir of the chapter
